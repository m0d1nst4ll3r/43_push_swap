# 43\_push\_swap

Checker done. Pretty useless, but hey.

For checker, used 1-way chained lists. Also used a 1-way list for operations.

I can't see the upside of a 2-way list. But I haven't looked at sorting algorithms yet...

Re-using the same skeleton as the checker for the actual prog is probably a good idea. Implementing functions to copy the stacks will be useful to sort several times using different algorithms and compare how long the operations list is. Same thing for op list (having several will be useful).

All that's left now, apart from re-using everything from checker to make a solver version, is to look at sorting, which is the ACTUAL hard part.
